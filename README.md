### Project Description
Calm Wave is an interactive web platform designed to help users relieve stress and enhance their mental well-being.
Through relaxing tasks such as breathing exercises, guided meditation, music therapy, and fun activities, users can reduce anxiety, stay calm, and improve their focus.

### The Problem statement
Stress is a silent killer! In today's fast-paced world, people are overwhelmed with daily pressures, tight deadlines, and constant multitasking. 
Finding the right moment and place to relax is often challenging‚Äîmany don't know when or where to take a break.

### The Solution
Calm Wave offers a range of engaging, relaxing activities to help people de-stress and rejuvenate their minds. 
Users can take a break with soothing music, simple meditations, stress-relief tasks, or even art therapy. 
Calm Wave is here to make relaxation just a click away‚Äîit's time to ride the Calm Wave to peace and mindfulness!
